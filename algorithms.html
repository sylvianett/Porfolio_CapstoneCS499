    <h2>Artifact Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This artifact is based on my CS 320 work involving the development and testing of a Java service for managing appointment data.
      The project applies validation logic to enforce business rules and includes unit tests written with JUnit to ensure correctness.
      For CS 499, I enhanced this artifact to better demonstrate algorithmic thinking and effective use of data structures by improving
      test design and reducing repetitive test code.

    <h2>Why This Artifact Is Included</h2>
    <p>
      I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates how algorithmic principles and data structures can be applied
      to produce more maintainable and scalable software. While service logic and validation rules are important, the enhancement focuses
      on improving how the project is tested by organizing test cases using structured collections and repeatable patterns. This approach
      reflects professional testing practices and strengthens the reliability and long-term maintainability of the solution.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Used <strong>structured collections</strong> to store multiple test case inputs instead of writing duplicated unit test code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Applied an <strong>iterative execution pattern</strong> to run validation scenarios efficiently and consistently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improved test organization by using a scalable method that allows future test cases to be added with minimal code changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strengthened overall reliability by validating expected results across multiple edge cases (including invalid inputs).

    <h2>Enhancement Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Before:</strong> Unit tests were repetitive and required manual duplication for each new scenario.</li>
      <li><strong>After:</strong> Unit tests were refactored into a structured approach using collections and repeatable execution patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Result:</strong> Cleaner test code, easier maintenance, scalable testing design, and stronger demonstration of algorithms/data structures.</li>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Enhancing this artifact helped me understand how data structures and algorithmic approaches can improve the quality of unit tests.
      By converting repetitive tests into data-driven patterns, I improved the maintainability of the test suite while keeping validation coverage strong.
      A challenge in this enhancement was ensuring that refactoring did not reduce test coverage, which required careful planning and review of expected outcomes.
      Overall, the enhancement strengthened my ability to design scalable solutions and reinforced the importance of clean, structured testing.
